# Neural-network

My own implementation of standard MLP with backpropagation learning algorithm. To create own implementation, I was motivated by project for parallel programming course in Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies in Bratislava. I used parallel programming model OpenMP.

As inspiration I used this great tutorial for implementation of MLP http://www.millermattson.com/dave/?p=54

*Note: I didn't use github versioning from the begging of project*
